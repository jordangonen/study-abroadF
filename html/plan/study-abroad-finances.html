  <h1>Study Abroad Finances</h1>
  <p>
Study Abroad is an investment and planning ahead is an important component of the study abroad experience, especially when it comes to finances. Not only should students understand the educational costs of a program, but they should also anticipate the other costs that will be associated with their travel.  </p>

  <h1>Tuition While Abroad</h1>
  <br />
  <h3>Semester</h3>
  <p>
    Those students studying abroad for a semester or an academic year for academic credit will be charged tuition by Washington University at a rate equivalent to tuition on campus for the corresponding time period. These charges are the same regardless of the program the student chooses and they will be billed via the Washington University student account. If the family uses a payment plan such as the PEP Plan or TuitionPay Plan, they will be able to continue to use the plan to cover the costs of participation. If the student is a child of a Washington University employee who is eligible for a tuition reduction benefit, this benefit may be applied to the tuition cost of the study abroad program.
  </p>
  <h3>Summer</h3>
  <p>
    Costs of summer programs will vary significantly depending on their location, duration, and features. If the program is a Washington University program led by Washington University faculty, program costs will be billed via the Washington University student account. If the program is approved by Overseas Programs but not led by Washington University faculty, students will pay fees directly to the program’s sponsor.

  <h1>Financial Aid</h1>
  <br />
  <h3>Semester</h3>
  <p>
    Students should expect to be able to pay for the costs of studying abroad in generally the same way they finance their studies on the Washington University campus. If they receive financial assistance, whether loans, scholarships, or a combination of the above, those will apply to a semester or academic year study abroad program fees as they would apply to on-campus costs. Students who anticipate that the educational costs of study abroad will be notably higher than their on-campus needs should consult with Student Financial Services to see if their financial aid package can be reviewed in light of the higher costs.
  </p>
  <h3>Summer</h3>
  <p>
    Students’ financial aid packages do not generally provide funding for summer experiences, domestic or international. If additional funding is needed to make summer study abroad possible, we encourage students to explore both Washington University and external Scholarship Opportunities and discuss with Student Financial Services whether additional loans are available.

  <h1>Make a Budget
</h1>
  <p>
    Every study abroad experience requires some financial planning and it is important to anticipate expenses, both those billed by Washington University and those that will be out-of-pocket, so you can enjoy your experience without breaking the bank. It can be helpful to create categories for expenses such as “fixed” for international health insurance and tuition or “essential” like international airfare, housing, food not covered by program costs, and public transportation and make sure those costs can be covered. Students should set a budget for personal expenses like toiletries, personal purchases, entertainment and personal travel. It is always useful to have a reserve fund in case of emergency or other unforeseen expenses.
  </p>
  </ul>
  <ul class="no-bullets" id="main-text">
  <h1>Withdrawal and Refund</h1>
  <p>
Circumstances, both academic and personal, can change significantly between the time a student applies to study abroad and the time that program would conclude. Those changes may make it necessary for the student to rethink the decision to study abroad and this can happen either before the start of the program or once the program has begun. If a student decides to withdraw, they must notify the Office of Overseas Programs in writing. Unless the student is incapacitated, the notification must come directly from the student and include the student's name, Washington University student ID number, program sponsor, program location, date and reason for withdrawal. It is also a student’s responsibility to notify the program provider of the decision, if applicable. If the withdrawal occurs prior to November 1 for Spring programs and prior to June 1 for Fall/Academic year programs, financial consequences are likely to be limited. If the withdrawal occur after the start of the program, financial consequences can be significant and it is unlikely any credit can be awarded if the student has not completed the scheduled academic instruction and examinations.
